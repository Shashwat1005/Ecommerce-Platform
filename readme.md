# Brief Introduction

This project is a fully functional e-commerce platform built using the MERN stack and Redux. It features a comprehensive shopping cart with PayPal and credit card payment options, along with essential functionalities such as product reviews, ratings, a top products carousel, and product pagination. Additionally, it offers robust admin controls, including product and user management, order details, and the ability to mark orders as delivered. The platform also supports a seamless checkout process and includes a database seeder for products and users.

The Payment Gateway uses PayPal Sandbox mode, meaning all payments made are dummy transactions, and no actual funds are transferred.
